# Style Transfer

## Topics covered in today's module
* Image preprocessing utilities
* Image deprocessing utilities
* Content Loss
* Style Loss
* Style Transfer

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Style transfer is a technique that allows generating an image with the content of one image and the style of another image.
* Style transfer involves using a pre-trained deep neural network, such as VGG19, to extract features from the content and style images and combining them to create a stylized output.
* The process of style transfer involves computing the content loss and style loss, which are used to optimize the generated image to match the content of the input image and the style of the style reference image.
*Other state-of-the-art models, such as AdaIN, can be used for style transfer, which may produce more realistic and detailed stylized images.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* The challenging aspect was understanding the different components involved in style transfer and how to implement them using a pre-trained deep neural network.
* The interesting aspect was seeing how the combination of content and style features can produce a new image that captures the essence of both input images.
