# Artificial Neural Networks

## Topics covered in today's module
* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Hyperparameters
* Forward Pass
* Backpropagation
* Computing accuracy

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* CNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited for image recognition tasks.
* Convolutional layers use a set of learnable filters (kernels) to perform convolutions on the input image and produce feature maps.
* Kernels can be visualized to gain an understanding of what patterns they are detecting in the input image.
* Feature maps can also be visualized to see what patterns the convolutional layer is detecting in the input image.
* Pooling layers are used to downsample the feature maps and reduce their dimensionality, which can help reduce overfitting and improve computational efficiency.
* Dropout is a regularization technique that can help prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out some of the neurons during training.
* Batch normalization is a technique that helps stabilize the distribution of inputs to each layer and improve the training process.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
I found visualizing the kernels and feature maps is particularly interesting, as it can give insights into how the network is processing the input image.
