# Ethics and Bias

## Topics covered in today's module
* Data Ethics
* Feedback loops
* Bias

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
* Bias is present in almost all datasets, and machine learning models can amplify that bias and cause harm.
* It is important to understand and address the potential for bias in machine learning models, particularly those used at scale, to ensure equitable outcomes for all individuals.
* Diverse perspectives and input can improve decision-making processes and lead to more fair and inclusive outcomes.
* Automated algorithms can also be biased and lead to unfair decision-making if not designed with inclusivity in mind.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* The most challenging aspect was thinking critically about bias in machine learning models and consider approaches to mitigate potential harms.
* It is an exciting opportunity to apply these concepts to real-world examples and explore ways to create more equitable models.
