# Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)

## Topics covered in today's module
* Generative Adversarial Network
* Generator
* Discriminator

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
GANs, including the generator and discriminator models, and the use of a latent space for generating new examples. Additionally, we discussed the similarities and differences between GANs and autoencoders.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
* The most challenging aspect was understanding the mathematical concepts behind GANs and how they work together to generate new data.
* The most exciting aspect was the ability to generate new and novel examples within a specific domain using GANs.
